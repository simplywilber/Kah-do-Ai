Kah-Do is an AI Chatbot utilizing Google’s large language multimodal, Gemini. `Google’s Gemini API` is used to initiate the generative model, delivering responsive interactions to user prompts. Integrated backend logic for dynamic creation of the chat user interface. The frontend is coded with `React` and `TailwindCSS`  ensuring a seamless and intuitive user interface.

## Inspiration 

The inspiration behind Kah-Do is drawn from my personal experience during a visit to Japan, where I immersed myself in the unique atmosphere of a 2D cafe, the design of Kah-Do is a tribute to that memorable encounter.

The word カード, pronounced as Kādo or 'Kah-do,' was the first Japanese word I learned and frequently used during my trip. In everyday situations, you would often say Kādo when referring to making card payments. It was precisely during these moments of relying on AI for transactions that I found the term becoming an integral part of my journey."

During my time in Tokyo, I utilized AI to seamlessly communicate with others, access valuable resources, and seek assistance. This experience left a lasting impression, inspiring me to create my own pocket AI Chatbot. The concept of Kah-Do was born from the blend of this personal journey and the captivating ambiance of a Japanese cafe, resulting in the creation of an AI Chatbot that goes beyond functionality, offering a unique and delightful user experience.
